  been maintaining.

  I am currently pursuing Btech CE in ######## and I am in first year. Even
  though its been fine so far I am still Trying to study for atleast an hour a
  day so I acquire the habit of studying.

  For my physical fitness I try to do atleat 101 Pushups on the days I dont go
  to gym but currently pumped up the number of pushups to 151 so that my
  capacity increases. i also try to go to gym regularly and eat good so that I
  stay physically fit.
